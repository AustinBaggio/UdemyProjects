Intro Projects from Udemy intro to React-Native

This app was to familiarize myself with the React-Native environment. It walked through simple API calls, component creation, scrolling 
and general familiarity with Node.js and installing frameworks with NPM. 

To run the app on an android device, install react-native, plug in an android device to your USB and execute 
terminal: react-native run-android
